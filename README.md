# Starbucks Capstone
To increase sales and customer satisfaction, companies often give promotions (like BOGO - Buy one Get one, rebate & reward programs) to customers, so that customer come back more often. By identifying customer purchase patterns, companies more precisely can target the users who purchase less frequently. By doing analysis like given an offer, we can find out user conversion rate. In the project, I plan to do such type of analysis using the Starbucks data which contains simulated data of customer transactions collected using Starbuck rewards mobile app. The data is a simplified version of real Starbucks app.
